ModApk748 - Netlify-ready static site
=====================================

This package contains a static website you can deploy to Netlify.

Files:
- index.html, mods.html, books.html, book-category.html, configs.html, admin.html
- style.css (neon professional styling)
- app.js (client-side data + admin functions using localStorage)
- README.md

Important notes:
- Admin password is included client-side as requested for demo: @gmail.com/Prince7488
- This admin system is client-side (localStorage). To make content shared across all visitors you need to hook it into a backend (Firebase, Netlify Functions, Supabase).
